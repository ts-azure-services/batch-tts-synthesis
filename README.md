# text-to-speech-long-audio
A repo to collect some artifacts to process a raw text file and get audio output using one of Azure's
pre-built voices. This is helpful to create audio outputs for material when an acoustic medium is
preferred. Attribution to the code files present
[here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Speech-TTS/tree/master/CustomVoice-API-Samples/Python#note),
with the main documentation
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/long-audio-api). This
leverages REST calls vs. the Speech SDK. Batch synthesis code examples
[here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/batch-synthesis).

To run through steps, reference the Makefile.
